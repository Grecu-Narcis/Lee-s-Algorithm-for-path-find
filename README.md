# Lee-s-Algorithm-for-path-find

This a path find visualizer created by me.
Once you compile&run the program you have to select a start point and a stop point.
Then you will be able to create walls for the maze.

To select start/stop point or to create a wall press left click button!
To undo a wall press right click button on it!

After you created the walls press F1 to start!

In the end it will display in the bottom part the number of steps needed to reach stop point from start point, if it's possible, otherwise it will display a message to tell it's impossible.

Have fun with it!:)
